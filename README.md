FIT2099 S1 2024 Bootcamps repository

## Getting started
Monash University FIT2099 Object Oriented Programming using Java: This repository is the work I have done during my studies for FIT2099, which teaches object oriented programming concepts using the Java programming language. Throughout this unit, OOP topics such as inheritance, encapsulation, interfaces are taught, as well as how to draw UML diagrams for system design and code structure planning.
